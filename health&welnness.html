            </li> <br>
            <li>
              Biguanides: Metformin, the most commonly prescribed biguanide,
              works primarily by decreasing glucose production in the liver and
              improving insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat cells. This
              medication is typically the first-line treatment for Type 2
              diabetes due to its efficacy and low risk of causing low blood
              sugar (hypoglycemia).
            </li> <br>
            <li>
              DPP-4 Inhibitors: DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin and
              saxagliptin, help to increase insulin release in response to meals
              and decrease the amount of glucose produced by the liver. They are
              generally well-tolerated and can be used alone or in combination
              with other diabetes medications.
